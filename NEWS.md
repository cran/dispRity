dispRity v1.6.0 (2021-04-16) *dispRitree*
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

 * *New* metric: `projections` that allows to measure elements' projection on an arbitrary axis (or their distance from this axis with `measure = "distance"`).
 * *New* metric: `projections.tree` that allows to measure elements' projection on axis between elements of a given tree.
 * *New* metric: `edge.length.tree` the edge length from each element given a tree (with the option `to.root = TRUE/FALSE` to measure the edge length from the element to the root of the tree (default = TRUE) or the nearest ancestor (FALSE).
 * You can now save the shifts results in `test.metric` with `save.steps` and then visualise them with `plot.dispRity` along side the disparity metric test results.
 * *New* utility function `n.subsets` to directly get the number of subsets in a `dispRity` object.
 * *New* statistical test: `randtest.dispRity` that is a wrapper for `ade4::randtest` applied to `dispRity` objects (not dissimilar from `null.test`).
 * Six more demo datasets have been added to the package! These datasets are the ones used in [Guillerme et al. 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ece3.6452) and published originally in [Beck & Lee 2014](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.1278) (that one was originally the only demo dataset in the package), [Wright 2017](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-paleontology/article/bayesian-estimation-of-fossil-phylogenies-and-the-evolution-of-early-to-middle-paleozoic-crinoids-echinodermata/E37972902541CD0995AAD08A1122BD54), [Marcy et al. 2016](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12862-016-0782-1), [Hopkins & Pearson 2016](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Melanie-Hopkins/publication/320543447_Non-linear_ontogenetic_shape_change_in_Cryptolithus_tesselatus_Trilobita_using_three-dimensional_geometric_morphometrics/links/59f7307d0f7e9b553ebd5e03/Non-linear-ontogenetic-shape-change-in-Cryptolithus-tesselatus-Trilobita-using-three-dimensional-geometric-morphometrics.pdf)), [Jones et al. 2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1365-2745.12405), [Healy et al. 2019](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-019-0938-7). Thanks to all these authors for their open science work!
 * `dispRity` objects now have a reserved `$tree` component that contain any number of trees attached to the data. This allows any function to use the reserved argument name `tree` to extract directly the relevant tree from the `dispRity` object, for functions like `chrono.subsets` or metrics like `ancestral.dist`! To help manipulate the `tree` component of the `dispRity` object, you can now use the new utility functions `add.tree`, `get.tree` and `remove.tree`.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENT

  * Reverted R version requirement from `4.0` back to `3.6` following [Joseph Brown's issue](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity/issues/107) and [fix](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity/pull/108).
  * `reduce.space` `"random"` algorithm now outputs a named logical vector (like the other algorithms!).
  * remove the `"only"` text when printing `dispRity` objects that contains "only" matrices (even though that can be 10k matrices!).
  * added a dedicated behaviour to `summary.dispRity` for `"dispRity"` `"randtest"` objects to output "ready-to-publish" result tables.
  * some error messages have been updated to be slightly more useful.
  * added the `estimation.details` argument to `multi.ace` allowing to also return specific arguments from the ancestral states estimation (thanks to [Armin Elsler](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/armin-elsler) for the suggestion).
  * Added new option `inc.nodes` to `clean.data` whether to check if the nodes in the tree match the labels in the matrix.
  * `make.metric` with the option `silent = TRUE` now outputs a list of info rather than only the level of the metric. You can reproduce the old behaviour using `make.metric(..., silent = TRUE)$type)`.
  * Fixed bug in `plot` using `preview` when the given argument `pch` did not match the number of groups (the different `pch` arguments are now used correctly).
  * Completely revamped the `ancestral.dist` metric. The function is now much faster and much easier to use (due to the new `dispRity` object structure). The options `nodes.coords` has been removed and the option `full` is now changed by `to.root`. If you still really want to use the older version of `ancestral.dist` using `ancestral.dist.deprecated` though.
  * The `dimensions` option throughout the package (e.g. in the `dispRity` function) can now also be a vector of dimensions to take into consideration (e.g. `c(1,2,5)`).

### BUG FIXES

  * `chrono.subsets` now automatically detects the number of digits to round for the internal time slicing functions (thanks to [Mario Corio](https://mariocoiro.blog/) for finding this one).
  * Fixed bug in `test.metric` plots that now display correctly the "top" and "bottom" changes for the "position" shift.
  * Fixed bug in `test.metric` plots that now display the R^2 values correctly.
  * Fixed bug in `tree.age` when the tree tips/node labels vector is longer than the actual number of tips/nodes in the tree.

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * Removed former version of `ancestral.dist` (see NEW FEATURES above).
  * Removed `node.coordinates` function (no replacement; you must use a package version prior 1.5.10 to use this function).
  * Removed `get.ancestors` function (no replacement; you must use a package version prior 1.5.10 to use this function).

dispRity v1.5.0 (2020-09-25) *between groups*
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * *New* function: `multi.ace` for performing fast ancestral character estimations on multiple matrices (based on `castor::asr_mk_model`).
  * *New* function: `reduce.space`, a function to modify trait spaces imported from the [`moms` shiny app](https://github.com/TGuillerme/moms). This function comes with a new reduction algorithm: the "evenness" algorithm for flattening the curve (thanks to [Gavin Thomas](https://github.com/ghthomas) for the suggestion).
  * *New* function: `test.metric` (and associated `plot`, `print` and `summary` functions), to apply the `reduce.space` function on a specific space and metric to test whether a metric is picking up specific changes in trait space.
  * the `dispRity` function can now use `"between.groups"` metrics to calculate disparity between groups rather than within groups. The `make.metric` function is now modified to allow detection of metrics that can be applied between groups.
  * *New* metric: `group.dist`, a dimension level 1 metric for between groups that measures the distance between two groups. By default, this is the minimum distance but the function takes the `probs` argument allowing the distance to be between, says, the 95% CI (`probs = c(0.025, 0.975))`) or between the centroids (`probs = c(0.5)`).
  * *New* metric: `point.dist`, a dimension level 2 metric for between groups that measures the distance between the rows in `matrix` to a point in `matrix2`. That point is the centroid by default but the `point` argument can take any function.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * The `dispRity` package now depends on `R (>= 4.0.0)`.
  * Many updates to the `dispRity` manual.
  * Many minor speed improvements across the package
  * Simplified syntax for the internal `plot.dispRity` S3 methods (for a potential `ggpRity`?). These changes should not be apparent at the user level but see the two removed options below:
  * **removed** option in `plot.dispRity`: the `chrono.subsets` option (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) has now been removed. The time-slicing-ness is now automatically detected or can be specified by the user normally through `xlab`.
  * **removed** option in `plot.dispRity`: the `ylim`, `ylab`, `xlab` and `col` options have now been removed. They are now handled through `...` as normal generic `plot(...)` arguments.
  * **removed** option in `plot.dispRity`: the `elements.pch` option has now been removed. The `pch` of the plotted elements can now be passed like other options directly to elements (e.g. `elements = list(pch = 15)`).
  * **removed** option in `plot.dispRity`: the `dimensions`, `matrix`, `nclass` and `coeff` options have now been removed. Any options for dual class plots (`randtest`, `dtt`, `model.test`, `type = "preview"` etc...) are now handled through the generic `specific.args` argument.
  * *New* option in `dtt.dispRity`: `scale.time` allowing to scale the time axis (like in `geiger::dtt`) or not.
  * when plotting `chrono.subsets` `dispRity` objects, the x label ticks are now rounded if possible (for nicer looking plots!).
  * when using automatic `chrono.subsets` time slices, the name of the time slices (their age) is now rounded for aesthetics.


### BUG FIXES

  * Updated all calls to the `Claddis` package to match version 0.6 (thanks to [Graeme Lloyd](http://graemetlloyd.com/) for fixing [this one](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity/pull/104)!)
  * Updated `Claddis.ordination` function to be compatible with the new `ape` version `5.4` (thanks to [Emmanuel Paradis](https://github.com/emmanuelparadis) for the pointing that out).
  * Fixed a bug in `chrono.subsets` where ladder trees with no tip branch lengths an `method = "continuous"` option would get stuck in an infinite loop.
  * Fixed a bug in `chrono.subsets` where the `"*.split"` methods would bug if the last slice is through a single edge.
  * Fixed a bug in `dispRity` where some 1D matrices could loose their class for certain metrics.

dispRity v1.4.0 *getting faster* (2020-05-05)
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

 * *New* metric: `angles`, a dimension level 2 metric that measures the angle of the main axis of each dimension in a matrix (in slopes, angles or degrees).
 * *New* metric: `deviations`, a dimension level 2 metric that measures the deviation of each element from a hyperplane.
 * Completely rewritten `char.diff` function. It now uses a way faster bitwise comparison architecture and comes with different distance methods as well as modular optional arguments on how to treat various special tokens (`"?"`, `"-"`, `"&"`, etc.). This also allows many more distance methods (now including `"hamming"`, `"manhattan"`, `"comparable"`, `"euclidean"`, `"maximum"` and `"mord"`).
 * all `dispRity` functions can now intake a single `"matrix"` or a `"list"` of matrices with the same row names and dimensions. The disparity is then calculated directly on all the matrices and summarised as before through `summary.dispRity`. This option can be used to add uncertainty to disparity calculations. For example in `chrono.subsets` you can now provide a list of trees and a list of associated ancestral state estimates; or for `custom.subsets` you can provide a list of matrices with different values representing different estimations of the traits.

### BUG FIXES

  * update `reduce.matrix` to work with `vegan::vegdist` version 2.5-6 (thanks to [Jari Oksanen for the fix](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity/pull/85)).
  * updated class evaluations throughout the package for `R` version `4.0.0`: `class(.) == *` is now `is(., *)`.
  * updated `...` argument bug PR#16223.
  * In `make.metric` the argument `...` is now ignored if any `names(...)` is `"tree"` or `"phy"`.
  * fixed bug in `neighbours` and `span.tree.length` when feeding "distance" like metrics (thanks to [Ashley Reaney](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashley-Reaney)
 for finding that one).

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * greatly improved speed of `chrono.subsets` with `method = "continuous` (now > 1000 times faster!).
  * minor warning message fix for `plot.dispRity` with time slices.
  * removed `paleotree` package dependency (though the links to this excellent package are still there!).
  * increased `R` version requirement to `3.5`.
  * `...` in `summary.dispRity` are now directly passed to `cent.tend` (e.g. `na.rm = TRUE`).
  * added some time improvements in several phylo functions based on the `castor` package.
  * updated all the package demo data to fit the new `dispRity` object architecture (see above). Note that this might effect the exact results of calculations using these demo datasets.
  * you can now specify the dimensions of the matrix to make a disparity metric in `make.metric` through the `data.dim` option. 
  * metrics passed in `dispRity` are now tested using the input data dimensions.
  * `chrono.subsets` with multiple trees now stretches the root edges length to match the oldest tree.


dispRity v1.3 *many metrics* (2019-08-15)
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

 * *New* metric: `displacements`, a dimension level 2 metric that measures the position of elements in space (i.e. their distance from the centre relative to their distance to their centroid).
 * *New* metric: `neighbours`, a dimension level 2 metric that measures the distance from an element to its neighbour (e.g. the nearest neighbour, the furthest, the median, etc.).
 * *New* metric: `quantiles`, a dimension level 2 metric that measures the *n*th quantile range per axis (a good alternative to the `ranges` function!).
 * *New* metric: `func.eve`, a dimension level 1 metric that measures the functional evenness (i.e. the spread along the minimum spanning tree; from Villéger et al. 2008).
 * *New* metric: `func.div`, a dimension level 1 metric that measures the functional divergence (i.e. the ratio of deviation from the centroid; from Villéger et al. 2008).
 * *Updated* metric: `span.tree.length` now outputs the length of each edges (c.f. the sum of the length) and becomes a level 2 metric.
 * The `chrono.subsets` can now take `multiPhylo` objects for slicing through multiple trees at once!
 * *New* utility function: `reduce.matrix` for optimising data overlap in a matrix with missing data.
 * *New* utility function: `slide.nodes` for sliding specific nodes on a tree.
 * *New* utility function: `remove.zero.brlen` for stochastically removing zero branch lengths on a tree (using the `slide.nodes` function).
 * **New argument** in `plot.dispRity`: the `type` argument can now be `"preview"` to have a glimpse at two of the dimensions of the trait-space.
 * The `Claddis.ordination` can now directly take a matrix's path as input (leaving the function to read and transform the matrix into `Claddis` format. The function can thus now also be used to convert matrices into `Claddis` format.
 * Added a "Other functionalities" section to the manual describing miscellaneous functions.

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

 * `centroids` and `ancestral.dist` functions can now take the `method` option for `"euclidean"` or `"manhattan"` distances.

 * Error messages in `dispRity` are more verbose when input the wrong metric(s).
 * `scree` option in `space.maker` does not require to sum up to one anymore.
 * `cor.matrix` option in `space.maker` does not require to have a valid Choleski decomposition (an approximation is used instead).
 * Updated all tests and functions to be compatible with R 3.6.
 * Fixed bug in `clean.data` that did not output dropped tips correctly when applied on `multiPhylo` objects.
 * Improved error messages in `chrono.subsets` for funky time slices/bins (e.g. with negative values).
 * Speed improvements for the `time.slice` function.
 * Better internal handling of distance matrices for the disparity metrics.
 * Most functions handles `NA` as `na.rm` or `na.omit`.

dispRity v1.2.3 (2019-03-12)
=========================

### NEW FEATURES

 * `dispRity` objects now contain a metric argument (if a metric was applied). This argument can now be recycled by the appropriate functions (e.g. in `null.test`).

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * `plot.dispRity` argument `observed` can now take a list of arguments to be passed `points()`.
  * `boot.matrix` now makes a error warning message when bootstrapping distance matrices (as suggested by [Dave Bapst](https://github.com/dwbapst/)!).
  * `geomorph.ordination` can now be used to simply create coordinates matrices (no ordination!) with `ordinate = FALSE` argument.
  * better internal handling of error messages.
  * `faster` eigen value estimations in `ellipse.volume` when the argument is left missing.
  * removed internal handling of the `Claddis.ordination` function. This function now uses the brand new version of the `Claddis` package on CRAN (0.3).

=========================

### NEW FEATURES

  * *New* functions: `model.test`, `model.test.sim` and `model.test.wrapper` for fitting models of disparity evolution through time (with associated manuals, vignettes and `S3` methods! Thanks to [Mark Puttick](https://github.com/PuttickMacroevolution)).
  * **New argument** in `boot.matrix`: `prob` for passing probabilities of sampling for specific elements.
  * S3 `print` method for objects of class `"dtt"` and `"dispRity"` (from `dtt.dispRity`).

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * tydiversed most of the error messages.
  * `dtt.dispRity` now allows to specify the alternative hypothesis (if `nsim > 0`).
  * `ellipse.volume` can now take an explicit eigen value vector (the eigen values are still automatically estimated correctly for PCO and MDS).
  * Improved metric checking messages from `make.metric` when dealing with optional arguments.
  * Removed cascade of warnings triggered by `plot.dispRity.dtt`.

### BUG FIXES

  * Corrected `char.diff` to properly reflect the probability of different splits between characters (thanks to [Abigail Pastore](https://github.com/aipastore)).

### BUG FIXES

  * Minor bug fixes and typos in various error messages and in the manual.

### DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT

  * Removed `Claddis.ordination` function to comply with the CRAN requirement (this function is still live in the [GitHub version](https://github.com/TGuillerme/dispRity) 1.1).

### MINOR IMPROVEMENTS

  * Many updates to the functions manual and vignettes.
  * Some algorithm are now greatly improved for speed.
  * Disparity can now be calculated as a distribution (i.e. `dispRity`, `test.dispRity`, `plot.dispRity`, and `summary.dispRity` can now intake one or more distribution rather than just one or more single values of disparity; whether the data is bootstrapped or not).
  * `dispRity` can now intake `dispRity` objects with level 2 disparity metrics.
  * `boot.matrix` and `dispRity` can now run in parallel.
